<p1>A black wolf is a melanistic colour variant of the gray wolf (Canis lupus).
[1][2] Black specimens are recorded among red wolves (Canis rufus), and these colour variants are probably 
still around today.[3] Genetic research from the Stanford University
 School of Medicine and the University of California, Los Angeles revealed
 that wolves with black pelts owe their distinctive coloration to a mutation which
 occurred in domestic dogs, and was carried to wolves through wolf-dog hybridization</p>
